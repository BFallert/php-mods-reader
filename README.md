# MODS Metadata Reader for PHP

Read [MODS](https://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/) XML into PHP objects that offer some convenient data extraction methods.

Requires at least PHP 7.4.

## Usage

* Create new instance of reader and pass the MODS XML as SimpleXMLElement.

## TODOs:

* Add missing reading for metadata (currently only the reading of top-level elements is implemented)
* Add test coverage
